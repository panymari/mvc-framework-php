# products catalog
Create catalog of products and services of online store
Don't do UI, but implement back-end logic in OOP. You should create 2 abstract base classes for products and services. Products will be TV-sets, laptops, mobile phones and fridges. Each product will have a name, manufactures, release date and cost. Services will be warranty service, delivery service, install and configure service. Each service will have a deadline, run queue and cost. All properties should be declared as non-public, while methods to access them should be declared as public. Users of your catalog should have the ability to select any product and service, read information about them  and calculate total cost of selected items. Users should not be able to select any service if they didn't select any product. But if they select products, you should advise them to select appropriate service.
You should use abstract classes, interfaces and traits with inheritance hierarchy and polymorphism.
